We have selected python as the main language to program our project in.  
To determine what programming language(s) to use for our project we checked what language the Nao robot was compatible with.  
We also discussed what languages people were familiar and comfortable working in.  
Our choices were between C++, Python, and Java.  
We then made the group decision to work in python for its ease of readability as well as its compatibility with the Nao robots.
