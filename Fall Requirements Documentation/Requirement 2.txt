Through testing the robot, the NAO showed a fair bit of arm dexterity through it's shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints, meaning that the robot has a rudimentary level of movement in it's arms comparable to humans. Additionally, it's three fingers can open and close in order to grip onto things, and while it's grip strength would likely not be suitable for tasks such as pulling itself up using it's arms alone, it is suitable enough for the task of grabbing and holding onto playing cards. Additionally, cartesian movement features in the robot allow it to reach for specific locations in it's field of view automatically, making that a viable feature to utilize during the course of the project. Additionally, it has hip, knee, and ankle joints, which help it to walk around with varying degrees of success based on the manor of control utilized. More precise coordination with leg and arm movements may be necessary in order to help the robot move around without it's center of gravity being thrown off and falling over. Additionally, though we could not find the NAO robot's previous username and password
login information, Liam was able to gain access to the robot's shell in order to create
a new username and password by use of NAOFlasher and a USB drive.
