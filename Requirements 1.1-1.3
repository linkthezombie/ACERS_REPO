Sawyer Robot:
Overview:
Single arm industrial manufacturing robot.
Product page https://www.rethinkrobotics.com/sawyer/ 
Seems like a bad fit. This is built for interacting with large objects. The SDK is centered around getting it to learn how to do a task, it may be difficult to wrangle it to play uno.
