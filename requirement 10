We needed to decide which of our three robot choices would work best for playing a card game.  
Our choices were between the Nao robots, the Pepper robots, or the Sawyer robots.  
The Pepper robot has an API that would be nice to work with, can already move and has a 3D camera for visual input, but it doesn’t have touch sensors on its fingers and is a little large.  
The Sawyer robot is mostly built for handling larger objects than playing cards and is mostly for industrial tasks, it is also very large, so it didn’t seem like a good fit for our project.  
The Nao robots are smaller and would have to be set on a table, but they have nice APIs as well and can move around.  
While the Nao robots don’t have sensors on their fingers, it would be possible to add them to the robot.  
After discussing as a group and reviewing our research on the three robots we decided to use the Nao robots for our project because of its API and movement capabilities.
