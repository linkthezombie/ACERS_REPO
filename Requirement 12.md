# Inverse Kinematics Model

The naoqi library already has the nao robot's inverse kinematics solved. This is
not only for simple kinematics solutions, but also where singularities and manifolds
exist.

The library calls this '(Cartesian contol)[http://doc.aldebaran.com/1-14/naoqi/motion/control-cartesian.html]'.

(libalmath)[http://doc.aldebaran.com/1-14/ref/libalmath/overview.html] is also
provided to make joint math easier.
